# Password Wizard

A Python-based password generator that creates random or enhanced passwords for improved security. Users can choose to generate a completely random password or provide a "base" password that will be enhanced with additional characters for added complexity.

## Features

- Utilize the multiple word banks.

### Future Quality of Life Enhancements
